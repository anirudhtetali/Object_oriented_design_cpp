* There are 2 classes **Line** and **Point**.
* The class line is a representation of a line on the cartesian plane
* The line consists of 2 points
* Data members of both the classes are private
* Each point is an instance of the class Point
* The co-ordinates of Point are double
* The class Line has following:
  * default constructor, copy constructor, initializer constructor
  * Methods to set either point independently or both at once
  * comparision operators ( == and != ) 
  * istream and ostream (>> and <<) operators
  * Distance() //length of the line
  * Slope() //slope of the line
